## By: Mateo Uno F. Dulay, Grade 9-Strontium

1. Give 2-4 key points from the SONA 2025 that you found interesting

    - Answers: 
        * PhilHealth will now cover Emergency Room cases.

        * Department of Health Hospitals will now have zero-balance billing.

        * Investigating corruption in infrastructure projects, specifically bridges.

        * Water companies were called out during the SONA.

2. Give 1-3 key points from SONA 2025 that you found weird for any reason (explaining is optional)

   - Answers: 
        * Additional 1.7B Pesos budget for treating other sicknesses not covered in Philhealth - This seems odd, because where are we getting the additional budget? This plan seems like it has a lot of flaws.

        * 50% discount off LRT and MRT rides for PWD, seniors, and students. - This is very beneficial on paper, but are we able to do this? Our budget is not in a good state already, due to the PhilHealth plans.

        * President Marcos Jr. talks about many educational promises, including giving free laptops and improved internet connection - This key point from SONA 2025 is a little bit weird, because it seems like a stretched promise that will take a huge chunk of our budget. 


3. Write 2 paragraphs of reflection (each paragraph is ideally around 4 sentences)

    - Paragraph 1: 
        * The plans created by President Marcos Jr. seems promising and beneficial to the Filipino people on paper. Examples of these are Free healthcare and 50% discounts for LRT and MRT rides. But a major flaw, is where are we getting the money? The plans could potentially backfire if not done correctly, so I hope that our leaders will commit to the plans and promises well.

    - Paragraph 2:
        * I found it odd that SONA 2025 started with a few finished projects (20 pesos rice, and employment rates), and the rest were promises to the Filipino people. Although the plans might backfire, I will give the benefit of the doubt because the plans sound good on paper. I hope that the five-minute response of Philippine National Police to crime calls is doable, because if the plan goes through, the Filipino people will have a sense of peace and safety. I pray that President Marcos Jr. will push through with these plans to expose corruption before his term ends. 

4. What 1 word/ phrase/ or sentence do you have for the Philippines after hearing SONA 2025?

    Answer: Are these claims illusion or reality?
