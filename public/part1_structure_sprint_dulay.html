    <h1>My Favorite Recipe: Watermelon Sinigang!</h1>
    <p id = "Paragraph1"></p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 Kilo of Flank steak</li>
        <li>1/2 Kilo of Beef Short Ribs</li>
        <li>1/4 Kilo of Ripe Watermelon</li>
        <li>Sinigang Mix</li>
        <li>5 pcs. Okra</li>
        <li>1 bundle Kangkong</li>
        <li>2 pcs. Native Tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 Onion</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>1 Knorr Beef Cube</li>
        <li>Water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cooking Tools:</h2>
    <ul> 
        <li>Cutting Board</li>
        <li>Knife</li>
        <li>Pot or Pressure Cooker</li>
        <li>Strainer</li>
        <li>Measuring Spoon</li>
        <li>Bowl</li>
        <li>Cup</li>
        <li>Spoon</li>
        <li>Fork</li>
        <li>Plate or Bowl for Serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut up all the vegetables and watermelon into bite sized pieces so that the ingredients will be cooked evenly.</li>
        <li>In a pot, place the cuts of meat and boil the meat for 15 minutes so that unwanted fat is removed from beef.</li>
        <li>After the 15 minutes is done, rinse the beef again under running water, and in a pressure cooker place the beef, <br> tomatoes, onion, ½ tablespoon of salt, ¼ tablespoon of pepper, and enough drinking water to cover the meat. <br> Now, the reason I am using a pressure cooker is because it’s faster and “more” efficient, but this is merely optional. <br> You can use a pressure cooker for 30 minutes or use a pot and cook the beef for 3 hours.</li>
        <li>The most important part of watermelon sinigang is watermelon. <br> And you must have a ripe watermelon or else the broth might taste bitter. <br> While the meat is cooking, in another pot boil the watermelon with 4 cups of drinking water <br> for 10 minutes to soften up the watermelon. <br> We do this so that we can remove the seeds easier.</li>
        <li>Once the watermelon is done boiling, separate the seeds from the juice and set it aside.</li>
        <li>When the 30 minutes is done, remove all the air inside before opening the pressure cooker to avoid accidents. <br> Once the air is removed, uncover the pressure cooker and place the watermelon juice inside.</li>
        <li>Once you have the watermelon inside the pressure cooker, mix it with kangkong and okra, and boil it for 10 minutes. <br> After the timer is done, add Sinigang mix and Knorr beef cubes. <br> Make sure all the sinigang mix and beef cubes are dissolved and after that turn off the heat.
</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Once it is all done, the finished product should smell like sinigang, but when you taste it, <br> it has a fruity and slightly sweet taste that complements the sourness of the sinigang mix. <br> The broth should also have a nice gold and reddish color with floating watermelon pieces. <br> Serve in a bowl and this is usually eaten with rice. Enjoy!</h3>
