## List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.

1. Comparison Operators - These include **equal** to (==), **not equal to** (!=), **greater than** (>), **less than** (<), **greater than equal to** (>=), **strictly equal to** (===), and more. These are syntaxes that compares values, and I am very familiar with using these thanks to my time using C++.

2. Logical Operators - These are syntaxes that works along with comparison operators, and relies on logic to return a boolean value (true or false). These include **and** (&&), **or** (||), and **not** (!). I am also very familiar with this because of my time on C++ exercises about logic.

3. Output Using Alert Dialog - This is a unique web building mechanism, where you can output a visual alarm using the **Alert(var)** function. This function allows you to output words on a window alert box. I am familiar with this topic because of the simple yet effective syntax.

4. Styling using CSS - This topic is a very important component in the world of web building or creating a website. CSS' syntax and usage is quite similar to C++ (in terms of simplicity), but it only focuses on design and components that give flair to the developers' website.

5. Two Kinds Of While Loop Structures - There are two kinds of "while" loops are the **do...while** and **while** loop structures. The **while** loop structure's job is "do this one task until a condition is fulfilled". The **do...while** loop structure's job is to "do this task ONCE and then check the condition, if it's fulfilled, stop. If it still isn't fulfilled, continue until it is done.".


## List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.

1. For...In Loops - **For...In** loops are unique loop structures that basically "does a task" using all values in an *object* (a special type of variable). This task could either be "output this value", "add these values", or more. I need a bit more practice with this because my syntax is wrong most of the time whenever I need it in an exercise.

2. Arrays - **Arrays** are a very tricky data storage function in JavaScript, in which it stores an ordered list of values with the same data type. I need a little bit more mastery on this, because I haven't really used this in my exercises and exams.

3. Nested For Loops - **Nested for loops is special**, because it works by putting a for loop INSIDE a for loop. The syntax is basically: "For each iteration in the 1st loop, run the job for the 2nd loop completely.". I need a bit more practice with this because whenever I use the nested for loop, it usually ends in disaster.

4. On Click - **On Click** is an event handler inside HTML which could be connected to JavaScript for a task to be done and reflect it inside HTML. I am quite familiar with this, yet I still need mastery on this because I haven't used it much in my HTML projects.

5. On Load - **On Load** is an event handler inside HTML which could be connected to JavaScript for a task to be done whenever an object or element is loaded (an example is the website itself). I need mastery on this because I have not used this at all in any of my projects.

## Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.

- My plan of action to help myself understand the topics im weak in, is to use all of it in a couple exercises and exams. By fully understanding the syntax, I am able to fully comprehend how each of these topics work.

## In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?

- Two exercises that effective was the Second Graded Exercise and Third Graded Exercise. These two exercises is effective in learning and mastering the syntax for Arithmetic, Logical, and Comparison Operators. Honestly, I haven't encountered an exercise that wasn't effective. Each one of them molded me to use syntaxes I wasn't familiar with, and forced me to have some skill in using it, slowly building my mastery on these topics.
